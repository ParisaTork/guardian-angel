For the Guardian Hack Day (November 2022)

## The Cost of Living Crisis and its intersectional challenges

There are many social initiatives that aim to help with the current cost of living crisis e.g. [food banks](https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/find-a-foodbank/), [warm spaces](https://warmspaces.org/). However, these initiatives often overlook those with health conditions that affect their ability to be physically mobile. This is a major issue, given that [nearly half of everyone in poverty is either a disabled person or lives with a disabled person](https://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/news/2020/february/nearly-half-everyone-poverty-either-disabled-person-or-lives-disabled-person). 

## The Energy Crisis
The cost of living crisis is also an energy crisis, which is ever worsened by other pressing political issues, including climate change, national and international geopolitical instability and war, as well as the pandemic. The government is not doing [enough](https://www.scope.org.uk/campaigns/cost-of-living-crisis/) to support those in most need of help e.g. people recovering from [cancer](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/cancer-information-and-support/get-help/financial-and-work/everything-in-our-power#:~:text=You%20may%20need%20to%20turn,more%20on%20their%20energy%20bills.) who require additional heating.

## Warm Spaces and the need for an alternate solution
Not everyone can afford to go and sit in a [warm space](https://warmspaces.org/) for a couple hours e.g. those undergoing dialysis. So they need a solution brought to them. This is where Guardian angels could step in and help, in a mission to bring portable heating equipment to people's homes to help them keep warm.

## Guardian Angels
Volunteers would be needed to:
* Take portable heating equipment to people's homes
* Donate portable heating equipment
* Donate generators
* Generate electricity for generators i.e. via renewable sources of energy and cycle-days
* Perform outreach to find people who require this service
* Donate money to keep the scheme running
